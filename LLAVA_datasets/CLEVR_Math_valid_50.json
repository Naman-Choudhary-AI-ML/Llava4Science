Starting from the left: a small yellow sphere, a slightly larger red sphere, a small green sphere, a cylindrical gray object, and a larger blue sphere.\n</CAPTION>\n\n<REASONING>\nBased on the arrangement of the objects from left to right, the order is as follows: yellow sphere, red sphere, green sphere, gray cylinder, and blue sphere. The problem requires identifying the object located in front of the green sphere and behind the small gray rubber object, which means it should be between these two objects. From the order, it is evident that the object fulfilling this condition is the blue sphere, which comes after the gray cylinder.\n</REASONING>\n\n<CONCLUSION>\nsphere\n</CONCLUSION>"
