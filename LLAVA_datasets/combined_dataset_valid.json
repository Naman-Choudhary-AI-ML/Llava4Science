Imitation of human behavior requires a\nviewpoint-invariant representation that captures the relationships between\nend-effectors (hands or robot grippers) and the environment, object attributes,\nand body pose. We train our representations using a metric learning loss, where\nmultiple simultaneous viewpoints of the same observation are attracted in the\nembedding space, while being repelled from temporal neighbors which are often\nvisually similar but functionally different. In other words, the model\nsimultaneously learns to recognize what is common between different-looking\nimages, and what is different between similar-looking images. This signal\ncauses our model to discover attributes that do not change across viewpoint,\nbut do change across time, while ignoring nuisance variables such as\nocclusions, motion blur, lighting and background. We demonstrate that this\nrepresentation can be used by a robot to directly mimic human poses without an\nexplicit correspondence, and that it can be used as a reward function within a\nreinforcement learning algorithm.
