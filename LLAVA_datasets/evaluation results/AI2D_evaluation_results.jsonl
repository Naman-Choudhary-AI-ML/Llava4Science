Starting with crystallization, rocks transform into igneous rock through cooling and hardening. This is marked as the first stage in the cycle. Next, rocks can undergo metamorphosis, changing into metamorphic rock. The cycle also includes sedimentary rock formation through deposition and weathering. Finally, rocks can melt, returning to the magma stage.\n\nThe task is to identify the label for \"igneous rock\" within the cycle.

The entire cycle is visually represented and labeled.\n\nREASONING: \nThe image begins with eggs, which hatch into larvae. The larvae eventually transform into adult ladybugs, and then the adult ladybugs lay eggs to start the cycle again. This cycle comprises four distinct stages: eggs, larvae, adult ladybugs, and pupae. Each stage is crucial to the survival and reproduction of the ladybug population.
