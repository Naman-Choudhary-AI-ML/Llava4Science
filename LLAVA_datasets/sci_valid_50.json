In order to\ncapture essential seizure features, this paper leverages an emerging deep\nlearning model, the independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN), to\nconstruct a new approach for the seizure/non-seizure classification.

Evaluations\nare conducted with cross-validation experiments across subjects over the noisy\ndata of CHB-MIT. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we explore how\nthe segment length affects the classification performance. Thirteen different\nsegment lengths are assessed, showing that the classification performance\nvaries over the segment lengths, and the maximal fluctuating margin is more\nthan 4%.

For the same total storage\nused, coding exploits the diversity in storage better than simple replication,\nand hence gives faster download.

Our system model and results are a novel\ngeneralization of the fork-join system that is studied in queueing theory\nliterature.

In this work I simulate several different reservoir computers and ask\nif the best performance really does come at this edge of chaos. I find that\nwhile it is possible to get optimum performance at the edge of chaos, there may\nalso be parameter values where the edge of chaos regime produces poor\nperformance.

At each time, individuals move\nin the multi-layer network of spatially-distributed patches according to their\nCTMC and subsequently interact with the local individuals in the patch\naccording to an SIS epidemic model. We derive a deterministic continuum limit\nmodel describing these mobility-epidemic interactions. We establish the\nexistence of a Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE) and an Endemic Equilibrium (EE)\nunder different parameter regimes and establish their (almost) global\nasymptotic stability using Lyapunov techniques. We derive simple sufficient\nconditions that highlight the influence of the multi-layer network on the\nstability of DFE.

        "response": "Question: What is the difference between the Transformer model and the modified model?\nAnswer: The Transformer model is a neural network architecture that was developed for machine translation. It is a self-attention model, which means that it uses attention mechanisms to learn relationships between different parts of the input sequence. The modified model is a variant of the Transformer model that has been modified to improve its performance on machine translation tasks. The modified model uses five parallel stacks, which means that it has five separate attention mechanisms that are used to learn relationships between different parts of the input sequence.\n\nQuestion: What is the significance of the validation loss?\nAnswer: The validation loss is a measure of how well the model is performing on a held-out dataset. It is used to evaluate the model's performance and to determine when to stop training. In this case, the validation loss is lower for the modified model than for the Transformer model. This indicates that the modified model is performing better on the held-out dataset.\n\nQuestion: What is the significance of the BLEU metric?\nAnswer: The BLEU metric is a measure of the similarity between a machine translation and a human translation. It is calculated by comparing the machine translation with a reference translation and counting the number of n-grams that are shared between the two translations. The BLEU metric is used to evaluate the performance of machine translation models. In this case, the BLEU score is higher for the modified model than for the Transformer model. This indicates that the modified model is generating translations that are more similar to human translations.\n\nQuestion: What are the implications of the results shown in the graph?\nAnswer: The results shown in the graph indicate that the modified model is performing better than the Transformer model on the IWSLT EN-DE task.

It needs to be pointed out that given an SNR \u03b3M , the numerical IOP results of OSS, IL-USS and IC-USS schemes are minimized by adjusting the overall data rates of RoM and RoS . As shown in Fig. 4, with an increasing SNR \u03b3M , the IOP of conventional OSS method almost keeps unchanged, further verifying that no SRT improvement is obtained by the OSS scheme in the case of \u03c32Mm = \u03c3 2 Ss = \u03c3 2 Me = \u03c3 2 Se = 1. Fig. 4 also shows that as the SNR \u03b3M increases, the IOP of ILUSS scheme initially decreases and then converges to a floor, while the proposed IC-USS scheme continuously decreases the IOP significantly. It can be observed from Fig. 4 that with an increasing SNR \u03b3M , the performance advantage of proposed IC-USS scheme over conventional OSS and IL-USS methods becomes more significant in terms of their IOPs. In addition, as the interference channel gains of \u03c32Ms and \u03c3 2 Sm increase from 0.1 to 0.2, the IOP performance of IL-USS worsens substantially, whereas our IC-USS scheme is very resistant to the interference channels without an IOP degradation.

By contrast, the USS allows MBS and SBS to\nsimultaneously transmit over the shared spectrum with the aid of power control\nfor limiting their mutual interference, thus called interference-limited USS\n(IL-USS). In order to take advantage of mutual interference in confusing the\neavesdropper without causing adverse effect on the MU, we propose an\ninterference-canceled USS (IC-USS) scheme. Closed-form expressions of overall\noutage probability and intercept probability are derived for OSS, IL-USS and\nIC-USS schemes by taking into account both MBS-MU and SBS-SU transmissions. The\nsecrecy diversity analysis is also carried out by characterizing an asymptotic\nbehavior of the overall outage probability with a given intercept probability\nin the high signal-to-noise ratio region. It is shown that the secrecy\ndiversity gains of conventional OSS and IL-USS are zero, whereas the proposed\nIC-USS achieves a higher secrecy diversity gain of one. This implies that with\nan arbitrarily low overall intercept probability, the conventional OSS and\nIL-USS methods converge to their respective outage probability floors, however\nthe proposed IC-USS scheme can make the overall outage probability\nasymptotically decrease to zero by simply increasing the transmit power.\nAdditionally, numerical results demonstrate an obvious advantage of the\nproposed IC-USS over OSS and IL-USS against eavesdropping.",

Each node is a location visited and stayed more than 3 mins by the user, with its size proportional to the frequency he/she visited the location. Two nodes are connected by a link if the user has traveled at least once between the two locations. In the literature, there are numerous models which aim to reproduce the statistical properties of human mobility networks [2, 8, 24]. Two crucial mechanisms in the pioneer models are (i) exploration, i.e., the tendency of users to visit new locations, and (ii) preferential return (PR), i.e., the tendency of users to re-visit locations according to the frequency that they were visited in the past [2]. As the tendency to explore new locations is set to decrease with time, the eventual dominant driving mechanism for human mobility in these models is preferential return, which successfully reproduces the power-law distribution of visitation frequency among locations and numerous other scaling laws observed in the empirical data. Many factors such as the population of the location and the aging effect are later introduced",

Seminal models which assume frequently visited locations tend to be\nre-visited, reproduce a wide range of statistical features including collective\nmobility fluxes and numerous scaling laws. However, these models cannot be\nverified at a time-scale relevant to our daily travel patterns as most\navailable data do not provide the necessary temporal resolution. In this work,\nwe re-examined human mobility mechanisms via comprehensive cell-phone position\ndata recorded at a high frequency up to every second. We found that the next\nlocation visited by users is not their most frequently visited ones in many\ncases. Instead, individuals exhibit origin-dependent, path-preferential\npatterns in their short time-scale mobility. These behaviors are prominent when\nthe temporal resolution of the data is high, and are thus overlooked in most\nprevious studies. Incorporating measured quantities from our high frequency\ndata into conventional human mobility models shows contradictory statistical\nresults.

A higher hospital factor means that more patients are being hospitalized, which can lead to a higher percentage of occupied beds. This can make it more difficult for hospitals to treat patients, and can lead to a higher mortality rate.",

        "abstract": "The paper develops a stochastic Agent-Based Model (ABM) mimicking the spread\nof infectious diseases in geographical domains. The model is designed to\nsimulate the spatiotemporal spread of SARS-CoV2 disease, known as COVID-19. Our\nSARS-CoV2-based ABM framework (CoV-ABM) simulates the spread at any\ngeographical scale, ranging from a village to a country and considers unique\ncharacteristics of SARS-CoV2 viruses such as its persistence in the\nenvironment. Therefore, unlike other simulators, CoV-ABM computes the density\nof active viruses inside each location space to get the virus transmission\nprobability for each agent. It also uses the local census and health data to\ncreate health and risk factor profiles for each individual. The proposed model\nrelies on a flexible timestamp scale to optimize the computational speed and\nthe level of detail. In our framework each agent represents a person\ninteracting with the surrounding space and other adjacent agents inside the\nsame space. Moreover, families stochastic daily tasks are formulated to get\ntracked by the corresponding family members. The model also formulates the\npossibility of meetings for each subset of friendships and relatives. The main\naim of the proposed framework is threefold: to illustrate the dynamics of\nSARS-CoV diseases, to identify places which have a higher probability to become\ninfection hubs and to provide a decision-support system to design efficient\ninterventions in order to fight against pandemics. The framework employs SEIHRD\ndynamics of viral diseases with different intervention scenarios. The paper\nsimulates the spread of COVID-19 in the State of Delaware, United States, with\nnear one million stochastic agents. The results achieved over a period of 15\nweeks with a timestamp of 1 hour show which places become the hubs of\ninfection. The paper also illustrates how hospitals get overwhelmed as the\noutbreak reaches its pick.",

        "abstract": "Due to the dramatic growth in mobile data traffic on one hand and the\nscarcity of the licensed spectrum on the other hand, mobile operators are\nconsidering the use of unlicensed bands (especially those in 5 GHz) as\ncomplementary spectrum for providing higher system capacity and better user\nexperience. This approach is currently being standardized by 3GPP under the\nname of LTE Licensed-Assisted Access (LTE-LAA). In this paper, we take a\nholistic approach for LTE-LAA small cell traffic balancing by jointly\noptimizing the use of the licensed and unlicensed bands. We pose this traffic\nbalancing as an optimization problem that seeks proportional fair coexistence\nof WiFi, small cell and macro cell users by adapting the transmission\nprobability of the LTE-LAA small cell in the licensed and unlicensed bands. The\nmotivation for this formulation is for the LTE-LAA small cell to switch between\nor aggregate licensed and unlicensed bands depending on the\ninterference/traffic level and the number of active users in each band. We\nderive a closed form solution for this optimization problem and additionally\npropose a transmission mechanism for the operation of the LTE-LAA small cell on\nboth bands. Through numerical and simulation results, we show that our proposed\ntraffic balancing scheme, besides enabling better LTE-WiFi coexistence and\nefficient utilization of the radio resources relative to the existing traffic\nbalancing scheme, also provides a better tradeoff between maximizing the total\nnetwork throughput and achieving fairness among all network flows compared to\nalternative approaches.",

        "abstract": "Massive MIMO is widely touted as an enabling technology for 5th generation\n(5G) mobile communications and beyond. On paper, the large excess of base\nstation (BS) antennas promises unprecedented spectral efficiency gains.\nUnfortunately, during the initial phase of industrial testing, a practical\nchallenge arose which threatens to undermine the actual deployment of massive\nMIMO: user mobility-induced channel Doppler. In fact, testing teams reported\nthat in moderate-mobility scenarios, e.g., 30 km/h of user equipment (UE)\nspeed, the performance drops up to 50% compared to the low-mobility scenario, a\nproblem rooted in the acute sensitivity of massive MIMO to this channel\nDoppler, and not foreseen by many theoretical papers on the subject. In order\nto deal with this \"curse of mobility\", we propose a novel form of channel\nprediction method, named Prony-based angular-delay domain (PAD) prediction,\nwhich is built on exploiting the specific angle-delay-Doppler structure of the\nmultipath. In particular, our method relies on the high angular-delay\nresolution which arises in the context of 5G. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthat when the number of base station antennas and the bandwidth are large, the\nprediction error of our PAD algorithm converges to zero for any UE velocity\nlevel, provided that only two accurate enough previous channel samples are\navailable. Moreover, when the channel samples are inaccurate, we propose to\ncombine the PAD algorithm with a denoising method for channel estimation phase\nbased on the subspace structure and the long-term statistics of the channel\nobservations. Simulation results show that under a realistic channel model of\n3GPP in rich scattering environment, our proposed method is able to overcome\nthis challenge and even approaches the performance of stationary scenarios\nwhere the channels do not vary at all.",

The graph shows the trajectory of the shortest path that is found using the stepwise-principle.\n\nQuestion: What is the significance of the 13 movement steps?\nAnswer: The 13 movement steps are significant because they represent the minimum number of steps required to travel from one point to another. This is important because it means that the vehicles will not have to travel any more than necessary, which will save time and energy.\n\nQuestion: What are the implications of this result for the design of autonomous vehicles?\nAnswer: The results of this study have implications for the design of autonomous vehicles. By using the stepwise-principle, autonomous vehicles can be programmed to find the shortest path to their destination, which will save time and energy. This will make autonomous vehicles more efficient and environmentally friendly.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a \"cooperative vehicle sorting\" strategy that seeks to\noptimally sort connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in a multi-lane platoon\nto reach an ideally organized platoon. In the proposed method, a CAV platoon is\nfirstly discretized into a grid system, where a CAV moves from one cell to\nanother in the discrete time-space domain. Then, the cooperative sorting\nproblem is modeled as a path-finding problem in the graphic domain. The problem\nis solved by the deterministic Astar algorithm with a stepwise strategy, where\nonly one vehicle can move within a movement step. The resultant shortest path\nis further optimized with an integer linear programming algorithm to minimize\nthe sorting time by allowing multiple movements within a step. To improve the\nalgorithm running time and address multiple shortest paths, a distributed\nstochastic Astar algorithm (DSA) is developed by introducing random\ndisturbances to the edge costs to break uniform paths (with equal path cost).\nNumerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed DSA method. The results report shorter sorting time and significantly\nimproved algorithm running time due to the use of DSA. In addition, we find\nthat the optimization performance can be further improved by increasing the\nnumber of processes in the distributed computing system.",

Second, the high percentage of positive samples with interactions suggests that it is important to consider the interactions between TFs when building a model. Third, the high percentage of windows with more than 1 TF binding suggests that it is important to use a model that can predict the binding of multiple TFs.

With more than hundreds\nof Transcription Factors (TFs) as labels, genomic-sequence based TFBS\nprediction is a challenging multi-label classification task. There are two\nmajor biological mechanisms for TF binding: (1) sequence-specific binding\npatterns on genomes known as \"motifs\" and (2) interactions among TFs known as\nco-binding effects. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture, the\nPrototype Matching Network (PMN) to mimic the TF binding mechanisms. Our PMN\nmodel automatically extracts prototypes (\"motif\"-like features) for each TF\nthrough a novel prototype-matching loss. Borrowing ideas from few-shot matching\nmodels, we use the notion of support set of prototypes and an LSTM to learn how\nTFs interact and bind to genomic sequences. On a reference TFBS dataset with\n$2.1$ $million$ genomic sequences, PMN significantly outperforms baselines and\nvalidates our design choices empirically. To our knowledge, this is the first\ndeep learning architecture that introduces prototype learning and considers\nTF-TF interactions for large-scale TFBS prediction.

In the classical auction theory for agents\nwith linear utility and single-dimensional preferences, Bulow and Roberts\n(1989) show that the optimal auction of Myerson (1981) is in fact optimizing\nmarginal revenue. In particular Myerson's virtual values are exactly the\nderivative of an appropriate revenue curve.\n  This paper considers mechanism design in environments where the agents have\nmulti-dimensional and non-linear preferences. Understanding good auctions for\nthese environments is considered to be the main challenge in Bayesian optimal\nmechanism design. In these environments maximizing marginal revenue may not be\noptimal and there is sometimes no direct way to implement the marginal revenue\nmaximization. Our contributions are three fold: we characterize the settings\nfor which marginal revenue maximization is optimal (by identifying an important\ncondition that we call revenue linearity), we give simple procedures for\nimplementing marginal revenue maximization in general, and we show that\nmarginal revenue maximization is approximately optimal. Our approximation\nfactor smoothly degrades in a term that quantifies how far the environment is\nfrom ideal (where marginal revenue maximization is optimal). Because the\nmarginal revenue mechanism is optimal for single-dimensional agents, our\ngeneralization immediately approximately extends many results for\nsingle-dimensional agents.\n  One of the biggest open questions in Bayesian algorithmic mechanism design is\ndeveloping methodologies that are not brute-force in the size of the agent type\nspace.

It is used to evaluate the performance of a binary classifier system by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The TPR is the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified, while the FPR is the proportion of false positives that are incorrectly identified.

One of\nthe driving reasons behind its high rate of infection is due to the\nunreliability and lack of RT-PCR testing. At times the turnaround results span\nas long as a couple of days, only to yield a roughly 70% sensitivity rate. As\nan alternative, recent research has investigated the use of Computer Vision\nwith Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification of COVID-19\nfrom CT scans. Due to an inherent lack of available COVID-19 CT data, these\nresearch efforts have been forced to leverage the use of Transfer Learning.\nThis commonly employed Deep Learning technique has shown to improve model\nperformance on tasks with relatively small amounts of data, as long as the\nSource feature space somewhat resembles the Target feature space.\nUnfortunately, a lack of similarity is often encountered in the classification\nof medical images as publicly available Source datasets usually lack the visual\nfeatures found in medical images. In this study, we propose the use of\nMulti-Source Transfer Learning (MSTL) to improve upon traditional Transfer\nLearning for the classification of COVID-19 from CT scans. With our\nmulti-source fine-tuning approach, our models outperformed baseline models\nfine-tuned with ImageNet.

Recent\nstudies have also indicated that DAS have advantages in wireless energy\ntransfer (WET). In this paper, we study simultaneous wireless information and\npower transfer (SWIPT) for a multiple-input single-output (MISO) DAS in the\ndownlink which consists of arbitrarily distributed remote antenna units (RAUs).\nIn order to save the energy cost, we adopt energy cooperation of energy\nharvesting (EH) and two-way energy flows to let the RAUs trade their harvested\nenergy through the smart grid network. Under individual EH constraints, per-RAU\npower constraints and various smart grid considerations, we investigate a power\nmanagement strategy that determines how to utilize the stochastically spatially\ndistributed harvested energy at the RAUs and how to trade the energy with the\nsmart grid simultaneously to supply maximum wireless information transfer (WIT)\nwith a minimum WET constraint for a receiver adopting power splitting (PS). Our\nanalysis shows that the optimal design can be achieved in two steps. The first\nstep is to maximize a new objective that can simultaneously maximize both WET\nand WIT, considering both the smart grid profitable and smart grid neutral\ncases. For the grid-profitable case, we derive the optimal full power strategy\nand provide a closed-form result to see under what condition this strategy is\nused. On the other hand, for the grid-neutral case, we illustrate that the\noptimal power policy has a double-threshold structure and present an optimal\nallocation strategy. The second step is then to solve the whole problem by\nobtaining the splitting power ratio based on the minimum WET constraint.\nSimulation results are provided to evaluate the performance under various\nsettings and characterize the double-threshold structure.",

Imitation of human behavior requires a\nviewpoint-invariant representation that captures the relationships between\nend-effectors (hands or robot grippers) and the environment, object attributes,\nand body pose. We train our representations using a metric learning loss, where\nmultiple simultaneous viewpoints of the same observation are attracted in the\nembedding space, while being repelled from temporal neighbors which are often\nvisually similar but functionally different. In other words, the model\nsimultaneously learns to recognize what is common between different-looking\nimages, and what is different between similar-looking images. This signal\ncauses our model to discover attributes that do not change across viewpoint,\nbut do change across time, while ignoring nuisance variables such as\nocclusions, motion blur, lighting and background. We demonstrate that this\nrepresentation can be used by a robot to directly mimic human poses without an\nexplicit correspondence, and that it can be used as a reward function within a\nreinforcement learning algorithm. While representations are learned from an\nunlabeled collection of task-related videos, robot behaviors such as pouring\nare learned by watching a single 3rd-person demonstration by a human. Reward\nfunctions obtained by following the human demonstrations under the learned\nrepresentation enable efficient reinforcement learning that is practical for\nreal-world robotic systems.

The MPC is simultaneously responsible for controlling the\nheating inputs of the HP and BB units for comfort management, as well as for\nthe control of energy flow between the PV, the home battery and the\nbidirectional grid system. Variable Time-of-Use (ToU) rates are considered for\nthe energy cost calculation and Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) is considered for selling\nenergy to the grid.

The reason is that users in the macrocells harvest more energy and have higher transmit power, resulting in more severe interference to the uplink in the picocells. Different from the performance behavior in the macrocells, DRSP-based user association actually outperforms the URDP-based strategy in the picocells. In addition, it is indicated from Figs. 7 and 8 that when the PBSs are dense and the number of MBS antennas is not very large, the uplink achievable rate in the picocell can be larger than that in the macrocell under DRSP-based user association.",

The only resource management task that developers are still\nin charge of is selecting how much resources are allocated to each worker\ninstance. However, selecting the optimal size of serverless functions is quite\nchallenging, so developers often neglect it despite its significant cost and\nperformance benefits. Existing approaches aiming to automate serverless\nfunctions resource sizing require dedicated performance tests, which are\ntime-consuming to implement and maintain. In this paper, we introduce an\napproach to predict the optimal resource size of a serverless function using\nmonitoring data from a single resource size. As our approach does not require\ndedicated performance tests, it enables cloud providers to implement resource\nsizing on a platform level and automate the last resource management task\nassociated with serverless functions. We evaluate our approach on three\ndifferent serverless applications, where it selects the optimal memory size for\n71.7% of the serverless functions and the second-best memory size for 22.3% of\nthe serverless functions, which results in an average speedup of 43.6% while\nsimultaneously decreasing average costs by 10.2%.",

We mainly focused on the preprocessing step\nfor every CAPTCHA which converts them in binary intensity and removes the\nconfusion as much as possible and developed various models to correctly label\nas many CAPTCHAs as possible.
